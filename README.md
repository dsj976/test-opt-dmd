# test-opt-dmd
A repository to test Optimized Dynamic Mode Decomposition (optDMD)

The purpose of this repository is to test the optimized dynamic mode decomposition (optDMD) algorithm, proposed by Askham and Kutz (2018).

Implementations of the optDMD algorithm can be found in the following repositories:

- [optdmd](https://github.com/duqbo/optdmd), written in MATLAB
- [PyDMD](https://github.com/PyDMD/PyDMD), written in Python. Here we focus on the `BOPDMD` class.
